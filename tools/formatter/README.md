# java.xml

The java.xml file contains coding conventions used by the OpenMRS Radiology Module.

The conventions are close to the OpenMRS conventions described in
http://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Coding+Conventions but do differ in some
aspects.

Import java.xml into Eclipse so that control-shift-f will format your code
accordingly.

However, .java files are automatically formatted according to java.xml when
compiling the radiology module with maven.

You can run the formatter from the command line with
```bash
mvn formatter:format
```
